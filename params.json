These types have stable and well-defined\r\n  semantics and are natively supported by the proto3 compiler and runtime.\r\n- `com.google.rpc` - Contains the types for general RPC systems. While gRPC\r\n  uses these types, they are not designed specifically to support gRPC.\r\n- `com.google.type` - Common types for Google APIs. All types defined in this\r\n  package are suitable for different APIs to exchange data, and will never break\r\n  binary compatibility.\r\n\r\nNon-generated code:\r\n\r\n- `com.google.api.gax.internal` - Contains classes that are designed for use by\r\n  generated API code and which may not be very usable by clients.\r\n- `com.google.api.gax.protobuf` - Contains classes that provide functionality on\r\n  top of protocol buffers. This includes things like expressions (to evaluate\r\n  conditions on protocol buffers), path templates (to compose and decompose\r\n  resource names), type (to represent field types in protocol buffers), etc.\r\n- `com.google.api.gax.grpc` - Contains classes that provide functionality on top\r\n  of gRPC calls, such as retry, page streaming, and request bundling.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nBSD - See [LICENSE] for more information.\r\n\r\n[CONTRIBUTING]:https://github.com/googleapis/gax-java/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n[LICENSE]: https://github.com/googleapis/gax-java/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n\r\n",
